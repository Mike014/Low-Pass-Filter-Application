# Low-Pass-Filter-Application
This web application allows users to apply a low-pass filter to a synthetically generated audio signal. Users can adjust the signal frequency, the filter cutoff frequency, and the resonance through a web interface. The original and filtered signals are visualized using Plotly, and the user can also play the filtered signal.
